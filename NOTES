New in version 1.1
+ Support for Classic
Pet cage attachments might look wrong.  Sorry.
+ Localizations for enUS, deDE, esES, esMX, frFR, itIT, koKR, ptBR, ruRU, zhCN, zhTW.
These are intended to work for the addon's main UI: group names, special senders and subject text (e.g. auction house stuff), chat messages.
They do NOT apply to configuration slash commands ("/gopost ...").  These are still enUS only.  Sorry.
PLEASE LEAVE A COMMENT OR SEND A PM IF YOU CAN CORRECT ANY OF THESE TRANSLATIONS!

New in version 1.01
+ GoPost can automatically expand groups containing messages when you open the mailbox.  You can configure this with:
/gopost expand single (the default) expands a group if it's the only one with messages
/gopost expand all expands all groups containing messages
/gopost expand none won't automatically expand anything

New in version 1.0
+ When looting money and items from Auction House mails, GoPost now prints specific messages like:
You purchased [Arkhana]x10 for 8g 99s 99c each from OtherPlayer
You receive cancelled item: [Arkhana]x10
You receive expired item: [Arkhana]x10
You receive 85g 49s 90c for [Arkhana]x10 at 8g 99s 99c each (SomeOtherPlayer)".
+ The modified chat messages are on by default.  You can turn them off for all groups with "/gopost chat none".  You can turn them back on with "/gopost chat all".
+ You can turn them off (or on) for a single group (e.g. Purchases) with "/gopost chat Purchases off".
+ Show a "?" icon on Sales messages when no real item icon is available.  This happens (rarely) when GetItemInfo(name) returns nil and no GET_ITEM_INFO_RECEIVED event ever fires.
+ Removed incorrect attachment count from Other messages that have no attachments.
+ Co-exists with Postal
+ new "/gopost version" prints the version number in the chat window
